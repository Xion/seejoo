_seejoo_ is an IRC utility bot coded in Python and built upon the Twisted networking library. Its main highlight is the extensible architecture: in most cases, new functionality can be added by implementing custom **commands** and **plugins**, rather than hacking the core code. This approach also allows for customizing the specific bot instance to meet one'a particular needs.
