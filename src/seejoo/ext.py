    Registers a new command. Commands are bot's utility functions that can be
    invoked on IRC by saying their names and arguments on the channel where
    bot is present (following prefix defined in configuration) or by sending
    a private message to the bot (with or without prefix).
    @param name: A name of the command. This is also the phrase used to invoke it
    @param cmd_object: A callable object which performs the command's action.
                       It should accept a single argument which will be
                       a string containing command's invocation parameters,
                       as well as keywords arguments such as 'user'.

# Plugins

def register_plugin(plugin):
    '''
    Registers a new plugin. Plugins are more complex utilities that can
    control bot's behavior in response to incoming events.
    A plugin is a callable that is invoked every time an IRC event occurs;
    it contains two required arguments (bot object & event type) and keyword arguments
    specific to particular event.
