    invoked on IRC by saying their names and arguments on the channel where
    bot is present (following prefix defined in configuration) or by sending
    a private message to the bot (with or without prefix).
    @param name: A name of the command. This is also the phrase used to invoke it
    @param cmd_object: A callable object which performs the command's action.
